# Parallel Web Crawler

In this project, the source code for a Java 5 single threaded web crawler was provided.  

The objective was to produce a modern Java 17 application. 

The following skills/features were demonstrated

* Crawler configuration via JSON (de)serialisation.  Annotations and parsing JSON files (Jackson) 
* Concurrent programming by implementing a recursive function and Forkjoinpool  
* Functional programming using stream api, lambdas, method references
* Design patterns (e.g. Builder)
* Measuring performance / Profiling by implementing a method interceptor
* Test driven development with Maven
